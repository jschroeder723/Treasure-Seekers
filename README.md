## TA and Section Time: Topher, Thurs. 4-6## Key Points
* The player can navigate through a multi-layered level in 2D with the goal of reaching the end of each level to “escape” the enemies chasing him/her once they acquire the needed score to pass the level.* Treasures will be scattered across the map that players can collect to increase the score needed to complete each level. Collecting these objects will result in the player’s speed to be decreased.* The primary way of defeating each level will be the use of the player’s “skill” to dig a hole, allowing the player to avoid the enemy by causing that enemy to fall to a lower layer of the level. This “skill” will have a cool down period so the player cannot constantly dig holes to avoid every enemy.* The player will use the “space” key to dig the holes and the arrow keys to navigate each level.* When a player falls through one of the holes he/she dug, he will fall to the lower layer of each level. If the player falls through the lowest layer, the player loses one life.* Each level is won when the player achieves the required score and reaches the exit (Exits will be randomly generated once the player reaches the score). A level is lost if the player runs out of lives.## Description of Physical Prototype

Our physical prototype is a simpler paper model of the type of level we are aiming to create. We have used paper to create the multi-layered map and to illustrate the player navigating through the map collecting the required items. We also use the prototype to display the general way of defeating enemies within our game.
