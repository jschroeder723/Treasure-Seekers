## TA and Section Time: Topher, Thurs. 4-6## Key Points
*	The player can navigate through a multi-layered level in 2D with the goal of reaching the end of each level to “escape” the enemies chasing him/her once they acquire the needed score to pass the level.*	Objects will be scattered across the map that players can collect to increase the score needed to complete each level.*	The core mechanics will revolve around different ways of “defeating” the enemies using interaction with the different layers of the map and the objects within the map.## Description of Physical Prototype

Our physical prototype is a simpler paper model of the type of level we are aiming to create. We have used paper to create the multi-layered map and to illustrate the player navigating through the map collecting the required items. We also use the prototype to display the general way of defeating enemies within our game.
